# Obsidian Plugin for finding external links

This plugin lets you search external links found in your notes. The search features with two possible actions.

## 1. Inserting an external link previously used in the notes

If you had a large number of external links used in your notes over some period of time, it is not easy to find them when you need to re-use them in your new notes. This plugin allows you to search the external links from the suggestion modal dialog and insert the selected link into your editor.

## 2. Find my favorite links using fuzzy search.

When you work on a note and need to open a website, you can open a search view, fuzzy-search the link and click to open it.
